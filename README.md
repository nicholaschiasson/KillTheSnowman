### Objective
It's voting season before Ludum Dare 31. Despite all odds, 'â˜ƒ' has somehow made it to the final round of voting. Naturally, this means that an onslaught of hate and disappointment is yet to come...

Play as the snowman and thwart as many incoming killer downvotes as you can by hitting them with snowballs. Score is based on how many downvotes you can thwart and how few snowballs you throw.
